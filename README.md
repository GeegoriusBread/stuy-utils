# StuyUtils-fork

ThunderRedStar's fork of Anthony Chen's [StuyUtils](https://github.com/achen318/stuy-utils). Is updated for the 2021-22 spring semester and has some more configurability.

All reimplementations are untested, use at your own risk. And feel free to open issues about my shitty python coding.

## Install
To download this (updated) module, run `pip install git+https://github.com/thunder-red-star/stuy-utils.git`

TODO:
- [x] Implement the new schedules
- [x] Add parsing for TSV
- [x] Add new Term Days
- [x] Deprecate methods involving Term Days until updates are pushed
